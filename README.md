# VideoFeedback
Sumbit pull requests to help me improve my videos.


* Have an idea to improve one of my videos, please submit a pull request.

* Maybe you have a security tip or know of an easier way to decrypt AES.

* Maybe you can show me how to engrave QR codes into steel by hand or something. 

* Maybe you can even teach me some cool OBS techniques. 

Anything is appreciated.

Thank you.
